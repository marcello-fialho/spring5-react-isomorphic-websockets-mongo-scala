# spring5-react-isomorphic-websockets-mongo-scala
## TL;DR
Please check my original repository, with the code written in Java (except for the client), for details. This one is written in Scala. It was mostly converted to Scala using scalagen. This is for those of you who may be interested in using Scala with Spring, and in particular, with WebFlux. **Disclaimer**: Using java libraries full of lambdas like Reactor in Scala will give you some amount of pain. There is a wrapper library for Reactor I am using, but the ides in Scala aren't at the same level as they are in Java. And yes, this does not use sbt, it uses maven. And yes, it uses mostly all the time Java classes. I think it is useful to show the Java community that they can leverage Scala to build a less verbose code base (without the need for Lombok). Overtime you can eventually migrate the code to use mostly only Scala types. The similarity of the code between the 2 repos is obviously no accident since I used scalagen, but it shows Scala can be used in the same environments Java is used, even Spring, with advantages. I obviously am no fan of Kotlin.

## Build steps:
